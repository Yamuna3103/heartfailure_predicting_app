# 🫀 Heart Failure Prediction App

A Machine Learning-powered web application built with **Streamlit** (or similar) to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients based on clinical inputs.

This project demonstrates a complete workflow of data preprocessing, model training, and deployment into a user-friendly interface.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this app is to enable users (doctors, researchers, or learners) to input patient health metrics and receive a **prediction on heart failure risk** using a trained machine learning model.

The model is trained on a heart failure clinical dataset and deployed via Streamlit or a similar Python web framework.
